# Where is my?

Still need to remember the url of the latest application for a project or client? Or the ssh login of a server of that project? Search no more, store website urls and ssh logins with tags etc. Find them with a browser extension based on opensearch or using a CLI.

# State

Pretty much very pre-alpha. Only the idea is presented here.

# Planning

See [TODO](doc/TODO.md)

# Ideas of features

- Store urls, ssh logins, etc.

- CLI to ssh login in terminal.
```
   whereismy project development --ssh
```

- CLI to print list of project
```
   whereismy project
```

```
development (ssh)
development-site (web)
production (ssh)
```

- CLI to go to website
```
   whereismy project development-site --web
```
