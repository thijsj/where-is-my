# Development

Description of how I develop this project.

### Python virtual environment

Make sure you have a python environment, skip steps if already done.

Create environment
```bash
python3 -m venv --prompt . env
```

Activate environment:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

For the remainder I assume you have an active environment

### Install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```
